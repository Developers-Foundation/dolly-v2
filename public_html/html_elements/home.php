                <p>
                    Weekly reading club meetings are held in the public primary schools in communities we serve.
                    Part of Dolly’s mission is to engage the children in the activities that will improve their
                    abilities academically and socially. We focus on providing reading material that inspire
                    excellence, leadership, and increase their literacy abilities. Our initiatives has resulted in
                    a marked improvement in the interest of children towards reading and their ability to express
                    themselves.<br>

                <p>
                    Sponsorships help children whose parents lack the financial backbone to support their schooling.
                    Before Dolly’s intervention, these children were unable to access desired and quality education
                    which greatly hindered their learning processes. Over the past ___ years, Dolly’s Children
                    Foundation has provided $_____ in sponsorships and helped ________ children go back to school.
                    Needless to say, the children being sponsored have improved dramatically in their academic
                    performance (on average by ____) and inherently, their social abilities and futures.

                <p>
                    Workshops and training sessions are held for teachers to bring modern education methods to them.
                    Teaching skills are the biggest influencer to how children learn and whether the children want to

                <h3>After school and Summer Tutoring Programs</h3>
                <p>
                    Extra tutoring programs are available after school as well as during the summer to help children
                    who are lagging behind academically. Child laborers, street children, and drop-outs are especially
                    benefited by this program. Teachers and volunteers engage these children in academic exercises to
                    effectively improve academic performance, reduce child labor, and child abuse.<br>
                    Community sensitization on the importance of education and child rights is often organized in
                    remote communities. This exercise has created a platform for counseling parents/guardians of
                    children from impoverished backgrounds who are easy target for environmental vices and such are
                    identified quickly. Furthermore, this program not only helps children academically, but also
                    emotionally by giving them more individual attention - making them feel loved, wanted,
                    and significant.

                <p>
                    School rebuilding is a project that we took on from 2015 where we refurbish public primary
                    schools with dilapidated structures. Dolly Children Foundation move into these out-dated
                    facilities to upgrade and equip them with the necessary educational material and infrastructure.
                    Thus far, a block of four classes, a staff office, a library, and a store have been built from
                    scratch. The project estimates to provide a healthy learning environment for over 500 children
                    by the end of 2018.
