                        Our weekly reading club meetings holds in the public primary schools and the communities we serve.
                        Part of our mission at DCF is to engage the children in activities that will
                        improve their abilities academically and socially.
                        We focus on providing reading materials that inspire excellence,
                        leadership and increase their literacy abilities. Our initiative has resulted in a marked improvement in the interest of
                        children towards reading and has improved their ability to express themselves.

                        Our Sponsor A Child program assists children whose parents lack the financial backbone to support their schooling.
                        Before our intervention, these children were unable to access desired and quality education which hindered their learning processes.
                        <br>
                        Over the past year, DCF has provided sponsorship inform of educational aid and welfare to over 50 children.
                        Needless to say, the children being sponsored have improved dramatically in their academic performance and their outlook to life has been impacted.

                        Extra tutoring programmes are available after school as well as during the summer to help children from low – income backgrounds that are lagging behind academically.
                        Child labourers, street children and drop – outs have specially benefitted from this program.
                        <br>
                        Teachers and volunteers engage these children in academic exercises to effectively improve academic performance, reduce child labour, and child abuse.
                        Furthermore, this program not only helps children academically, but also emotionally by giving them more individual attention thereby, making them feel loved, wanted and significant.

                        School rebuilding is a project we took on from 2015 where we refurbish public primary schools with dilapidated structures.
