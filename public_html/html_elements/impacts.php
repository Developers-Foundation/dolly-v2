                        Weekly reading club meetings are held in the public primary schools in communities we serve.
                        Part of Dolly’s mission is to engage the children in the activities that will improve their
                        abilities academically and socially. We focus on providing reading material that inspire
                        excellence, leadership, and increase their literacy abilities. Our initiatives has resulted in
                        a marked improvement in the interest of children towards reading and their ability to express
                        themselves.

                        Sponsorships help children whose parents lack the financial backbone to support their
                        schooling. Before Dolly’s intervention, these children were unable to access desired and
                        quality education which greatly hindered their learning processes. Over the past year, Dolly’s
                        Children Foundation has provided sponsorships and helped 50 children go back to school.
                        Needless to say, the children being sponsored have improved dramatically in their academic
                        performance and inherently, their social abilities and futures.

                        Workshops and training sessions are held for teachers to bring modern education methods to
                        them. Teaching skills are the biggest influencer to how children learn and whether the children
                        want to learn, we have helped 40 teachers with workshops over the past year with the ultimate
                        goal of benefiting the children. These workshops include Numeracy Made Easy, 21st Century
                        Teaching Methods, Phonics, and Understanding Your Learner.

                        Extra tutoring programs are available after school as well as during the summer to help
                        children who are lagging behind academically. Child laborers, street children, and drop-outs
                        are especially benefited by this program. Teachers and volunteers engage these children in
                        academic exercises to effectively improve academic performance, reduce child labor, and child
                        abuse.<br>
                        Community sensitization on the importance of education and child rights is often organized in
                        remote communities. This exercise has created a platform for counseling parents/guardians of
                        children from impoverished backgrounds who are easy target for environmental vices and such are
                        identified quickly. Furthermore, this program not only helps children academically, but also
                        emotionally by giving them more individual attention - making them feel loved, wanted, and
                        significant.

                        School rebuilding is a project that we took on from 2015 where we refurbish public primary
                        schools with dilapidated structures. Dolly Children Foundation move into these out-dated
                        facilities to upgrade and equip them with the necessary educational material and
                        infrastructure. Thus far, a block of four classes, a staff office, a library, and a store have
                        been built from scratch. The project estimates to provide a healthy learning environment for
                        over 500 children by the end of 2018.
